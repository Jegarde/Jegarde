# 😸 Hi buddy!
I love sharing my work for free, open to all. Have a look!

### 📒 Portfolio 
I am most known for my projects involving [Rec Room](https://recroom.com/), such as:
- [RecNetBot](https://github.com/RecNetBot-Development/RecNetBot), a *must-have* Discord bot for any Rec Room related server out there with thousands of monthly users.
  - Check our [RecNetBot Development](https://github.com/RecNetBot-Development/) organization out!
- [RecNetPy](https://github.com/RecNetBot-Development/RecNetPy), the most powerful Rec Room API wrapper that also powers [RecNetBot](https://github.com/RecNetBot-Development/RecNetBot).
- [RecNet-Login](https://github.com/Jegarde/RecNet-Login), a Python package made for generating a Rec Room OAuth2.0 bearer token.
- [CircuitsAPI](https://github.com/Jegarde/CircuitsAPI), a system to communicate with Rec Room's in-game circuits, which is not possible under normal circumstances.
- [RecRoomDiscordRPC](https://github.com/Jegarde/RecRoomDiscordRPC), a cross-platform Discord rich presence client for Rec Room. 
  
My other equally awesome projects include:
- [arduino-pomodoro](https://github.com/Jegarde/arduino-pomodoro), a cute feature-rich Pomodoro timer made with Arduino UNO R3.
- [TJ-API](https://github.com/Jegarde/TJ-API), a REST API for counting the days remaining in Finnish conscript service with ASP.NET Core.
