# ðŸ˜¸ Hi buddy!
I'm passionate about technology and cats. Open source for life.


### ðŸ“’ Portfolio 
I am most known for my projects involving [Rec Room](https://recroom.com/), such as:
- [RecNetBot](https://github.com/RecNetBot-Development/RecNetBot), a *must-have* Discord bot for any Rec Room related server out there with thousands of monthly users.
- [RecNetPy](https://github.com/RecNetBot-Development/RecNetPy), the most powerful Rec Room API wrapper that also powers RecNetBot.
- [RecNet-Login](https://github.com/Jegarde/RecNet-Login), a Python package made for fetching your Rec Room authorization token externally.

Make sure to check out the [RecNetBot Development](https://github.com/RecNetBot-Development/) organization where me and a couple of developer friends collaborate on the previously listed projects.
